PROJECT TITLE: Lab 5B
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Software Development Lab BCIT
VERSION or DATE: October 13 2018
AUTHORS: Monika Szucs

Create a Math class that has the following methods:

public int divide(int x, int y) ///returns x divided by y // but if y==0, print "ERROR" and return 0

public int max(int x, int y)//returns the bigger number: x or y

public int remainder(int x, int y) /// returns the remainder when x is divided by y //see above if y==0

public int triple(int x) //returns x times three

//return true if the operation is any of the "*", "/", "%", "+", or "-"; otherwise false: public boolean isValidOperation(String operation) //use a switch statement

Test your code to make sure it works using BlueJ (i.e. create and instance nad run each method) or by creating a Main class with a static main method that does the same.
